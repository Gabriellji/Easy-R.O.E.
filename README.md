## 3. Create and edit the `.env` file

This application uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), which allows to load variables from a specific file: `.env`. This is where sensitive data, such as database settings, JWT secret key, API keys, etc. are stored.

This file is **not** provided here, because it should **never** be committed! However, the `.env.sample` file will help create you quickly.

First, **copy it** as `.env`:

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

Second, **edit** `.env`. **You have to replace all the values with your own keys.
## Purpose
#### Accenture case study: 
Most of us at Accenture have been working from home due to the pandemic. Working on projects while managing your household has been a juggling act for all of us. 

The kids make surprise visits to your room during an important client call. Your physical fitness is lacking as you barely leave the house. The workdays get longer and itâ€™s becoming harder to distinguish between work and private life. 

From time-management, to fitness, to mental health, virtual meetups & games etc. In this new way of working, we would like to give you, the hackers, the opportunity to think of ways to improve the WFH experience for the hundreds of thousands of people like you & us who are embarking on the journey to the future of work.

### Hacking-from-Home
Our goal is to enhance applicants's UX in the process of apply to a company, RAMP is designed with a minimal, easy to use UI, all users can understand exactly in which step of the application process they are at the moment, and also know what to do next.

### MVP
We reach our mvp for STARTHack, but RAMP, can evolve and became a b2b product for companies, recruiters can easily manage the applicants from the admin UI. Send message (sms, email or whatsapp) to applicants thank to twilio integrated service.
